I guess if you're reading this post you're at a point where you decided, "I want to learn how to code." or "I'm interested in learning the python programming language. Well, I'm a person just like you, who is also interested in learrning to code and I've decided to try to learn python this time. Yes, this time, because I've tried to get going with coding MANY times over the last 20 years, but I've always (fairly quickly) hit a point where I felt I just wasn't getting it. So, let's keep our fingers crossed (when we're not typing) and give it another go, together.

First, I want to say that my goal isn't to become a full-time coder. I'm already in my mid-50's in a good job in another part of IT and I don't want to start all over again in a new role. My goal is to learn enough programming to help me in my current role and to broaden my skill-set to become a more valueable employee.

Second, my philosophy wiwth this blog is going to be take it slow and make sure I understand what I'm doing before moving on to the next step.

OK, I think that's enough for now.

Be careful out there.
